Hi everyone, I am @TestingLife - Zhangjinkun and I have been working on software testing for more than **15 years**. My interests are mainly in the technical research related to **software testing** and **test tool development**. I have some scientific achievements in the field of software automation testing, especially in bus communication interface based software automation testing, and automatic test data generation, see [my ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4506-3235) for details.

Thanks! :sparkling_heart:
